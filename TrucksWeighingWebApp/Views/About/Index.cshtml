    <hr />

    <p><strong>Trucks Weighing Web App</strong> is a web application for cargo surveyors and tally teams that helps control cargo weight during truck operations at terminals - in ports, warehouses, and silos (loading or discharging).</p>
    <p>Your data is stored securely in the database and can be accessed from multiple devices for team workflows.</p>
    <p>The app is free to use.</p>
    

    <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Features</h2>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>Responsive disign: </strong>optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
    <p><strong>Two control points:</strong> weighbridge and at berth (cargo operations).</p>
    <p><strong>Truck statuses:</strong> the operator at weighbridge point can see at glance the status of all trucks - after initial weighing, under cargo operations, arrival at the cargo operations area, cargo operations started/finished, and after final weighing.</p>
    <p><strong>Safety logic:</strong> the operator at the cargo operations point can verify, which trucks have passed the initial weighing and are ready for cargo operations.</p>
    <p><strong>Extended team workflow:</strong> multi-user concurrent input.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> add and update your notes during inspection, notes are visible to the tally team.</p>
    <p><strong>Plate number autocomplete:</strong> based on previously entered values.</p>
    <p><strong>Logo:</strong> select a logo on the inspection form, it is printed in the PDF header.</p>
    <p><strong>Logo uploads:</strong> up to 5 logos per account.</p>
    <p><strong>PDF export:</strong> standard daily and summary “Tally Sheet”, totals and balance, optional period filtering.</p>
    

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">How It Works</h2>
    <hr class="mt-1" />
    <ol>
        <li>Create an inspection (vessel, cargo, place, time zone, optional logo and notes).</li>
        <li>At the weighbridge, record initial truck data (plate, weight, time) — the list updates as you go.</li>
        <li>At the berth, mark start and completion of cargo operations per truck.</li>
        <li>If a second operator at the berth is not required, the double-check at the cargo operations point can be skipped.</li>
        <li>Finish with final weighing at the weighbridge.</li>
        <li>Review results and export a PDF (entire period or a selected date/time range).</li>
    </ol>
